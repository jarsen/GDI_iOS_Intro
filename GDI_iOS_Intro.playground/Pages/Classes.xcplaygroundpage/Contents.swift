# Classes
Classes (like structs) let you encapsulate multiple properties together. Unlike structs, classes are *NOT* value types
â€”they are _shared_ instances. Classes also allow for inheritance.

Structs can have methods, which are functions that are part of the struct and can use its variables.

/*:
Whoops! Turns out both our variables `favoritePizzaOrder` and `secondFavoritePizzaOrder`
were referring to the same object! So when we changed `secondFavoritePizzaOrder` we also
were mutating the object pointed to by `favoritePizzaOrder`

So you have to be careful with classes to make sure you're changing the right object.
The moral of the story is prefer `struct` whenever possible, and when you want an object to
specificially be shared by multiple parts of the app, use a `class`.
