# Put That Keyboard Away!
Making an app is a lot more than programming! Don't start coding till you have
planned it out!

# How to Make Money From Apps in 2015

---

# Make Your App the Best

There is a lot of competition on the app store, you have to stand out.

Sometimes, this isn't hard to do. There are a lot of crappy apps.

There are some indie developers who can make a living, but for most devs its just some extra money on the side.

# Start a Business
Most apps are selling for cheap or free. Most of the biggest apps are selling a service or driven by advertising (recurring revenue). You can make more money off of a business supported by an app than most apps will ever make.

Examples:
* Spotify
* Facebook / Instagram
* Google
* Etsy

# Start a Career

People will pay you $$$ to make apps!

# Cocoa Apps

While not exactly the same, learning Swift and how to use Xcode will enable you to build Mac apps.

# Cocoa Touch Apps

(But today we're going to talk just about iOS apps)

---

# Apple Frameworks Galore!

Not open source (double edged sword).

* UIKit - this is what apps are made of
* MapKit - apple maps
* CloudKit - store app data in the cloud
* StoreKit - handle app store transactions
* PassKit - digital tickets, boarding passes, member cards.
* Photos
* CoreAnimation

---

# Wanna make a game?

* 2D Games - SpriteKit
* 3D - SceneKit
* GameController - interface with controllers
* GameKit - networking, Game Center, voice chat...
* GameplayKit - game logic, AI

_Note: If you want a cross platform game, check out something like Unity3D_

---

# Lots of 3rd Party Frameworks

Use only as neccessary! Using code you don't understand can lead to pain.

---

# Resources

---

# API Documentation!

There's **A LOT** of documentation available at developer.apple.com

Xcode has a built in doc viewer. (Free)

I like [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) ($10 IAP)
