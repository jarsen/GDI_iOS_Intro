## Numbers

At the most basic level, all computers do is add and subtract numbers; everything else is just a bunch of fancy tricks
on top of addition and subtraction. There are several different types of number values in Swift. The most common are:

* `Int`    Signed Integer (can be negative integer)
* `UInt`   Unsigned Integer (only postitive integers)
* `Double` (64 bit floating point number)
* `Float`  (32 bit floating point number)

// Here is some simple arithmetic. Notice the result in the right sidebar of the playground.

7             // This is a signed integer
UInt(7)       // This is a unsigned integer
7.0           // This is a double

2 + 2
5 / 2         // Integer division
5.0 / 2       // You can force floating point division like this

0b1           // you can also write binary numbers
0xF           // and hexadecimal numbers
