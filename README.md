## Required Class Materials

* A mac running OS X Yosemite or later
* A free [developer account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/). You only need a paid developer account when you want to put your app on the store.
* The latest version of [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/). _Please download this before class, it's a large download. I will try to have a copy on an external hard drive just in case._
* If you want to put your app on a real device and not the simulator, you will need a device running the [iOS 9](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios9-preview/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features-com) beta. The beta is available [here](https://beta.apple.com)
