planned it out!

# How to Make Money From Apps in 2015

# Make Your App the Best

There is a lot of competition on the app store, you have to stand out.

Sometimes, this isn't hard to do. There are a lot of crappy apps.

There are some indie developers who can make a living, but for most devs its just some extra money on the side.

# Start a Business
Most apps are selling for cheap or free. Most of the biggest apps are selling a service or driven by advertising (recurring revenue). You can make more money off of a business supported by an app than most apps will ever make.

Examples:
* Spotify
* Facebook / Instagram
* Google
* Etsy

People will pay you $$$ to make apps!
